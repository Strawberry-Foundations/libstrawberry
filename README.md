# stblib-rust
stblib is a simple library used mostly by Strawberry Foundation's Projects.
stblib offers many different functions for simplifying the writing of Rust code. These include the following features: 

* Localization system with language strings
* Strawberry Chat API Wrapper for own Rust-based clients
* Scapi for programming bots for Strawberry Chat (currently incomplete)
* Logging for uncomplicated and simple logging of *some* things in a CLI application
* Notifications to send notifications (who would have thought it)
* Email to send e-mails
and some (kinda) useful utilities!
